since, with the exception of the Cecil MS. erroneously
stated by Wats as being ¹deposited in the CCC.
Library, Cambridge, no other copy of the Historia
Minor is known to have existed. That the Cecil MS.
did contain the lesser chronicle is clear from the various
readings given by Wats at the end os the printed edi·
tions of Paris, all differing much from the present re·
ceived text, and agreeing verbatim with the Royal MS.
Interesting, however, as this manuscript is on its own
account, it becomes even more valuable from the light
which, as the autograph of Paris, it throws upon the
question of the authenticity of Wendover’s history.
From a comparison of it with the Cambridge manu-
script, the innovations, whether by correction or ad-
dition, of Matthew Paris may be ascertained with the
most minute accuracy3 for in the first volume os the
latter MS, extending to the year 1189,l the additions
sometimes on the margin, at others by insertion of new
leaveS, at others again by erasures written over, are all
by precisely the same hand. The volume spoken of
appears, in fact, to be the very copy of Wendover’s
Chronicle, or the Great Chronicles of St. Alban's, used
by Paris as the foundation of his Historia Major,-
the ‘ copy' as it were from which his amended text was
to be transcribed. The second volume is by altogether
a different and a somewhat later hand. The text is
no longer Wendover’s, but, as it would seem, the tran-
scriptos Paris’ ‘first edition' of that chronicler, and it
is remarkable that it is apparently in the same hand·
writing with that of the Cotton MS. in the British
Museum. still, the textos Wendover is not altogether
left, and additions and erasures continue in the hand-

¹At the end ol the year 1188, in usqua adannurn Domini hic notatum?
the MS. ol the Historia Minor, occurs where allusion is evidently made to
the following note on the margin, the Cambridge MS, as is probably
‘Hec est vera contractio historie Ma· intended also in the marginal notent
thei Parisieusis in primo volumine, in the same pointel time in the MS. ol
quo habetur historia ab origine mundi Weudover.
