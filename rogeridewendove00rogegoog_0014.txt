how is it proved that Wendover wrote the remaindert
For an answer to this question the reader is referred
to the Preface of this edition, where, in addition to the
arguments adduced -in his behalf, may be added further
the mode of dividing the work, as it is recognized in
the compiler's prologue, as also the tacit acknow-
ledgment of Paris himself, in suffering to be inserted
on the margin of his new volume,l at the time when
Wendover terminated his labeum, the note following,
‘Huc usque scripsit cronica dominus Rogerus de Wan-
dovre,’ etc.

In preparing the present volume, the Editor has been
careful topreserve every important variation with which
- an accurate collation of the text with Wats’ edition of
Matthew Paris and the Variantes Lectiones of that editor
could furnish him. He has also, in any doubtful case,
sought assistance from the MSS. to which allusion has
been before made. At the same time that he has not
thought it necessary tc preserve every trifling deviation
· from the original, which, although highly important in
many cases in editing the classical writers of Rome and
Greece, can yet be but of little real value in an bis-
torian writing at a period when elegance of style was,
comparatively speaking, little cultivated. The varia-
tions to which ,allusion is here made are such as the
reading manubia· for ia perpetuam, sicat for prout, ia
sapam anteros for reliquos in sapam, eta, alternating very
much on the side of either historian. The additions,
however, are everywhere introduced, aad any marked
difference of style preserved. The following introduc-
tory'chapters of the Historia Minor are here appended,
in order to convey to the reader some idea of the mode

adopted by Paris in the composition of that highly
interesting Chronicle.
